## Description of the project

The "Movies" project is a web application that allows you to view the list of the user found by search query, as well as sort the found by category.

## Main functions

1. List of movies: When the application is deployed, the user sees a page with the requested list of movies/series in the form of cards. Each card represents a specific movie and contains its poster and basic information such as title and release year.

2. Movie search: Users can use the search function to find movies and series by title.

3. Sorting by categories: Users can choose to display only movies/series only, making their search more targeted.

## Technical details

- Frontend: The application is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For convenient and efficient display of movie cards, materializecss.com is used.

- API: The project uses a third-party API - OMDb API - to get information about movies and series.

## Project development

The "Movies" project can be expanded and improved in the future. Some ideas for further development include:

- User Accounts: The development of a user account system will allow users to save their preferences and mark movies they have already watched or want to watch.

- Recommendations: Implementing a recommendation system based on user preferences and viewing history will help offer personalized movie listings.

- Advanced Search: Adding advanced search capabilities for various criteria such as actors, directors, release year, and more.

- Comments and ratings: Developing the functionality of commenting on movies and rating their users can make the application more interactive.

- Mobile application: Creating a mobile application will allow users to access "Movies" from mobile devices and watch movies at any time.

## Conclusion

The "Movies" project provides a convenient way to view a list of films in the form of cards with the function of sorting by categories. This application will be an interesting and useful tool for cinephiles and anyone who wants to quickly find and get acquainted with films from different genres and eras.
